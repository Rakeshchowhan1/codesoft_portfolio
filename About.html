      About Me

      Hi, I’m Rakesh Chowhan, a passionate web developer and creative enthusiast with a keen eye for detail. I
      specialize in crafting engaging and user-friendly websites that bring ideas to life. My journey in technology
      started with a love for problem-solving and grew into a profession that combines logic with creativity.

      I am skilled in tools and technologies likeHTML, CSS and modern frameworks. Whether I’m building a sleek
      portfolio, an educational site, or an interactive project like my ongoing Solar System Website, I strive to
      deliver seamless and visually appealing experiences.

      Beyond coding, I’m a content creator. I run two YouTube channels:
      - Tech Tutorials:Exploring technology reviews, AI tools, and educational how-to videos.
      - Lyricsin_nature:Celebrating Bollywood songs, Bhakti music, and entertainment in harmony with nature.

      When I’m not coding or creating, you’ll find me enjoying photography, music, and exploring creative ways to merge
      technology with art.

      I’m always open to collaborating on innovative projects or sharing ideas. Let’s connect and create something
      extraordinary!
